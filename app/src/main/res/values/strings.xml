    <string name="api_problem">The Wolfram API limits the number of queries per application to 2000 per month.
        This means that the users of ”Formula Que” altogether just have 2000 queries per month! Unfortunately,
        right now, those queries are used up. \n\nSince ”Formula Que” is a non-profit, open source project that aims
        at education, it would be great if Wolfram Alpha increased (or better removed) the limit of queries per month.
       	\n\nUntil then, please vist Wolfram Alpha\'s webpage directly.</string>
